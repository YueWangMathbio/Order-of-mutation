# Order-of-mutation

This contains the code for Order-of-mutation effects on cancer progression: models for myeloproliferative neoplasm, by Yue Wang, Blerta Shtylla, Tom Chou, arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.09941.

In a generalized Moran process, this code calculates the expected time of having a double-mutation cell and the expected number of single-mutation cells at this time. This is done for three different sets of parameters (mechanisms/models).
